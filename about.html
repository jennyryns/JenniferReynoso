    Hello! I'm Jennifer, I am in the process of gaining a BFA in Film/Video at California Institute of the Arts.
    I grew up in Cathedral City,CA where I started making films in my early teen years; ever since then I was never able to be seperated from it since then.
    I enjoy creating identity based work and using film as a tool to better understand myself.
    In my free time I enjoy doing freelance work such as wedding and events.
